Some nifty commands for Laravel:

Check version: $ php artisan --version

Using Homestead as server, add domain name to hosts file: $ sudo vi /etc/hosts
    -> opens file in vim
    -> go to end of file type 'o' to add new line below curser
    -> copy/paste your new IP address with site domain ex. '192.168.10.10  homestead.app'
    -> press 'esc' to exit edit mode
    -> type ':wq' and press enter to save and quit

After configuring Shared Folders in Homestead.yaml, you must use command: $ homestead up
    -> you MUST run this command after setting filepath BEFORE you can access the server via 'http://homestead.app'

To access Homestead server: $ homestead ssh

Rename file .env.example to .env

$ php artisan tinker
